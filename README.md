## Programming Assignment:

In this programming assignment, you will find the shortest path from one vertex to another by implementing Dijkstra's algorithm.
See the PDF[CSCI-651 Programming Assignment 02.pdf] for more information.

### Languages & Technologies used:

- Java

### Steps to Run:

- Java SDK (9 or higher)
- Clone repo
- Open in preferred IDE
- Run Demo.java
- Run and enjoy!

### Output
The Demo has 2 diffrerent implementations, HashMap based which has Undirected and Directed Edges, and a Matrix implementation.  
The solution will print as:
```
Calculating Distance from node: a
Node: a, Distance: 0
Node: b, Distance: 75
Node: c, Distance: 118
Node: d, Distance: 203
Node: e, Distance: 65
Node: f, Distance: 164
Node: g, Distance: 145
Node: h, Distance: 242
Node: i, Distance: 275
Node: j, Distance: 175
Node: k, Distance: 224
Node: l, Distance: 264
Node: m, Distance: 100
Node: n, Distance: 130
Node: o, Distance: 190
Node: p, Distance: 263
Node: q, Distance: 270
Node: r, Distance: 282
Node: s, Distance: 310
Node: t, Distance: 272
The path from 'a' to 'i' is: 
a -> e -> g -> i

Total distance from 'a' to 'i' is 275
```
